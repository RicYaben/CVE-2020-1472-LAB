# ZeroLogon testing script

A lab setup to test a vulnerability for the ZeroLogon exploit (CVE-2020-1472).
It contains a Python script that uses the Impacket library to test the vulnerability, and a Virtual Machine (VM) with Windows Server 2019 configured as a Domain Controller (DC).

The script attempts to perform the Netlogon authentication bypass.
It will immediately terminate when successfully performing the bypass, and not perform any Netlogon operations.
When the DC is patched, the detection script will give up after sending a number of pairs of RPC calls and conclude the target is not vulnerable (with a false negative chance of 0.04%).

<details open>
    <summary><b>Requirements</b></summary>

- VirtualBox
- Vagrant
- Python

**Optional**

- Docker
  
</details>

The VM is already configured and available to the host in the address 192.168.33.10 under the name `VAGRANT`.
The VM does not have access to the Internet.
To start the VM using vagrant, run:
> Note: If you change the VM network configuration you may be exposing a vulnerable machine to the Internet. Do it at your own risk!

```bash
$ vagrant up
```

Then, launch the attack on the DC.
It is recommended to use the Dockerised version of this attack or in a `virtual environment`.

- For `Docker` run:
  
    ```bash
    # NOTE: On Windows, you may need to enable the `Hyper-V` Wiwndows feature.
    # NOTE2: On Windows, you may need to switch to `Linux Containers`.
    $ docker build -f Dockerfile . -t zerologon
    # This command run the zerologon test on the DC with domain VAGRANT in the address 192.168.33.10
    $ docker run zerologon VAGRANT 192.168.33.10
    ```

- For `VirtualEnv` run:

    ```bash
    $ python3 -m virtualenv zerologon
    $ zerologon/Scripts/Activate.ps1
    # NOTE: This may give you some issues with your firewall!!
    $ pip install git+https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python zerologon_tester.py VAGRANT 192.168.33.10
    ```

The output of this attack should look something like this:

![zerologon](assets/attack.png)

This script is only meant to test the viability of the attack, it does not exploit the server in any other way.
The script does not perform any changes to the DC.

The script targets can be used to target a DC or backup DC. It likely also works against a read-only DC, but this has not been tested. This lab contains a domain controller named `VAGRANT` with IP address `192.168.33.10`.

The DC name should be its NetBIOS computer name. If this name is not correct, the script will likely fail with a `STATUS_INVALID_COMPUTER_NAME` error.

A Whitepaper on this vulnerability will be published [here](https://www.secura.com/blog/zero-logon) on Monday 14 sept.

> **__NOTE__**:
> There is a very nice and visual tutorial [here](https://www.virtualgyanis.com/post/step-by-step-how-to-install-and-configure-domain-controller-on-windows-server-2019) to convert your Windows Server 2019 into a Domain Controller.
> The machine provided has been configured to:
>
>- Domain: lab.com
>- NetBIOS: LAB (The DC is still called `VAGRANT` though)

> **__NOTE2__**:
> If something goes sideways and you receive a `STATUS_INVALID_COMPUTER_NAME` error, run `nbtstat -A 192.168.33.10`, this will give you some insight on what is going on in that address.

> **__NOTE3__**:
> If the attack fails, it may be that the machine has been updated with security patches. Check the updates and remove anything that looks like `Security Patches` from 2020 onwards.
